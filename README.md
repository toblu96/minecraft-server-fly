# minecraft-server-fly

Scale-to-Zero Minecraft server deployed on Fly.io

## Goal of this project is to ...

- 🎈 learn about Fly.io deployments
- 🅾️ scale services to zero automatically
- 🚀 deploy Fly.io ressources with GitHub actions
- 🎮 play Minecraft with friends 😉

This idea comes from a Fly.io [blog post](https://fly.io/blog/scale-to-zero-minecraft/) whith slight adaptions.
